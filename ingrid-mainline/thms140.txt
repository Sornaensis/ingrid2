Unless otherwise stated these changes were made to the /tsl-compiler/theorems/theorems*.txt files.

24 - dont solve for girth in this one, it is necessary to calculate dummy variable k

35 - The FUCK-OR theorem change

60 - changed the bounds for girth when setting edges (in theorems140.py). Also, the incorrect bounds might be used when setting nodes and ncomp, but the original code is difficult to read.

86 - added, should be double checked, very long

91 - domination is not in this theorem. Changed

63 - added

67 - will need to be written by hand 

120 - the written equation seems good. Run it through the compiler again, if it does not work, then we must write by hand.

125 - the if else statement written is no good. fixed.

128 - added, kill me now, should be double checked, very long

132 - the if statements were flipped, I changed them

133 - added
